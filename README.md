# Custom_Spending_Report_AROG
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze how customers are spending, which regions are generating higher revenue, and how spending varies by age group, gender, and payment preference.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I built a Customer Spending Analysis Dashboard for Arog Company using Power BI.
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze how customers are spending, which regions are generating higher revenue, and how spending varies by age group, gender, and payment preference.
The dashboard helps the business understand customer behavior and identify high-value segments.

**📌 Key KPIs:**
At the top of the dashboard, I added summary cards to quickly show:

- Total Customers – 40K
- Total Spend – $401M
- Average Spend – 10K

These KPIs provide an instant overview of business performance.

**📊 Dashboard Insights**

- **Total Spend by Age Group**
This visual shows which age group contributes the most revenue.

From the analysis, customers aged 45+ appear to contribute the highest spending.

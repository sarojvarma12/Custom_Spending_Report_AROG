# Custom_Spending_Report_AROG
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze how customers are spending, which regions are generating higher revenue, and how spending varies by age group, gender, and payment preference.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I built a Customer Spending Analysis Dashboard for Arog Company using Power BI.
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze how customers are spending, which regions are generating higher revenue, and how spending varies by age group, gender, and payment preference.
The dashboard helps the business understand customer behavior and identify high-value segments.

**📌 Key KPIs:**
At the top of the dashboard, I added summary cards to quickly show:

- Total Customers – 40K
- Total Spend – $401M
- Average Spend – 10K

These KPIs provide an instant overview of business performance.

**📊 Dashboard Insights**

- **Total Spend by Age Group**
This visual shows which age group contributes the most revenue.
From the analysis, customers aged 45+ appear to contribute the highest spending.

- **Customer Payment Preference**
This donut chart shows how customers prefer to pay (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Cash, PayPal).
This helps the company optimize payment systems and promotional offers.

- **Total Spend by Region**
The regional bar chart highlights revenue contribution across:
- West
- North
- East
- South

The **West region ** generates the highest total spend.

- **Top 5 Customers by Total Spend**
This section identifies high-value customers, which is useful for:
- Loyalty programs
- Personalized marketing
- Retention strategies

- **Spending by Gender**
This visual compares spending across Male, Female, and Non-binary customers to understand demographic contribution.

🛠 **Tools & Skills Used**
- Power BI
- DAX measures (Total Spend, Average Spend, Customer Count)
- Interactive slicers (Age Group & Gender)
- Data visualization & dashboard design

💡 **Key Takeaways**
- The 45+ age group is the highest revenue contributor.
- The West region drives maximum revenue.
- Spending is fairly balanced across genders.
- A small group of customers contributes significantly higher revenue (top 5 analysis).
- Payment preferences are evenly distributed, showing diverse customer behavior.

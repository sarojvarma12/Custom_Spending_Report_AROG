In this project, I built a Customer Spending Analysis Dashboard for Arog Company using Power BI.
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze how customers are spending, which regions are generating higher revenue, and how spending varies by age group, gender, and payment preference.
The dashboard helps the business understand customer behavior and identify high-value segments.

At the top of the dashboard, I added summary cards to quickly show:
